# Clusters Directory

This directory contains configurations for your clusters. Create a subdirectory for each cluster using its domain name (e.g., `test.cluster.com`).

## Custom Charts

While KubeAid supports many [standard charts](https://github.com/Obmondo/k8id/tree/master/argocd-helm-charts), you can add custom charts by creating an `argocd-helm-charts` directory here.
